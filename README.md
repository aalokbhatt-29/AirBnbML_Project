<h1>Predicting Airbnb Guest Satisfaction in Popular European Cities</h1>
This project aims to predict guest satisfaction for Airbnb listings in popular European cities by using regression models on a dataset from Kaggle. This may help Airbnb guests decide which listings would be best for them and Airbnb hosts in learning what listing features are most important.

<h2>Dataset</h2>
The datasets used in this project were accessed from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/airbnb-prices-in-european-cities
<h2>Setup Instructions/Notes</h2>
Note: This project was done through Google Colab and the datasets were imported by mounting Google Drive. These instructions will share how to run the notebook by the method we used.

1. Create a shortcut to the Google Drive folder of the datasets ([AirBNB Datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14sWbVJNZlC91WNW8AUcy3pZj-fRgXcoD)) under 'My Drive'
2. Open the Final_Project.ipynb notebook and run the first two cells. If mounting Drive worked, then you may ignore the following cell (where the csv files are read through manual upload).
3. Continue running the other cells one by one to train and evaluate the regression models.

Here is a video demonstration of how to run this project: [Video Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11XBy8vUSFZpCibKycDEUk1rYRSFcc2Gk/view?usp=sharing)
